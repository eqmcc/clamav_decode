The whole idea is loopping over the whole pattern and find a sub pattern that has the least overlapping(means most different from others in terms of sub strings) against other patterns that have been loaded into the filterAnd all the qgrams(a int 16, constructed by2 characters from the selected sub patterns) should be put in a qgram-map(similar to bitmap in shift-all algo) and in addition, due to the various length of each selected sub pattern, an end set qgram map is created tomark the end of each selected sub patternThis end set approach would actually cause false positive, e.gThe whole idea is loopping over the whole pattern and find a sub pattern that has the least overlapping(means most different from others in terms of sub strings) against other patterns that have been loaded into the filterAnd all the qgrams(a int 16, constructed by2 characters from the selected sub patterns) should be put in a qgram-map(similar to bitmap in shift-all algo) and in addition, due to the various length of each selected sub pattern, an end set qgram map is created tomark the end of each selected sub patternThis end set approach would actually cause false positive testtesttesttestMYOtestTEST The whole idea is loopping over the whole pattern and find a sub pattern that has the least overlapping(means most different from others in terms of sub strings) against other patterns that have been loaded into the filterAnd all the qgrams(a int 16, constructed by2 characters from the selected sub patterns) should be put in a qgram-map(similar to bitmap in shift-all algo) and in addition, due to the various length of each selected sub pattern, an end set qgram map is created tomark the end of each selected sub patternThis end set approach would actually cause false positive
