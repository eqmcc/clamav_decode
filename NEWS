hash matcher, and other minor issues. Please see the ChangeLog file for
details.

*** Announcement ***

The ClamAV project is launching a new service called "Third Party web
interface". It will allow selected individuals/organizations to publish
ClamAV Virus Databases (CVD) through the ClamAV mirror network.

If you choose to publish your signatures through our Third Party
web interface you will benefit from the following:

- before publishing the signatures, we will test them for
  false positives against our false positive file collection.
- before publishing the signatures, we'll verify that the latest two major
  versions of ClamAV can load them correctly.
- the signatures will be digitally signed and packaged into a single
  .cvd compressed file.
- there will be no ".UNOFFICIAL" suffix in the detection names.
- a custom prefix will be added to the detection names, identifying the
  organization which published the signature.
- updates will be distributed both as full CVD files and cdiff
  incremental updates. Users will benefit from lower network traffic.
- the .cvd and .cdiff files will be distributed through the
  ClamAV mirror network.
- the service should result in faster remediation of false positives.
- ClamAV users will be able to download the third party databases
  using freshclam, by adding a single line to freshclam.conf, what
  should make signature maintenance significantly easier.

The service is still in beta, you are welcome to contact Luca Gibelli
<luca*clamav.net> if you intend to join the beta program.

We especially welcome those who already distribute their own unofficial
signatures to join. A list of databases distributed by the new service
will be available at http://www.clamav.net/download/cvd/3rdparty

We will be happy to answer any questions you might have.
